# Lab-01b - Markdown Syntax

Markdown (like all languages) is very sensitive to tiny changes, even when creating this page I was confused why my file wouldn't format my text as markup. Turns out, I forgot to add the .md to the page name. Without this there was nothing to tell GitHub what to do with all that text! All file extensions work like this- .html, .css, .js, etc.

If you know anything about html, markdown is incredibly similar. It was created to be a friendlier method of publishing content. When you are just working with the essentials of a website such as text and images it is much easier to only need to add one symbol rather than adding an opening and closing tag over and over.

For example:

Adding a header to your traditional html website would formatted as such:

``` <h1> This is a header in html </h1> ```

The same header in Markdown would be:

``` # This is a header in Markdown ```

See? Not to mention that you have to worry about other "chunks" of code such as the <!HTML> or <body> tags. However, if you are more familiar with html or you just want to mix it up, you can use common html tags such as `<p>`, `<li>`, and many other to do the same exact thing. You can also add styling properties to your tags such as `witdth`.
