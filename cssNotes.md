# CSS Notes

CSS is the behind the scenes code (still front end) that lets us modify elements of our HTML page. We can change color, placement, font, and way more. 

We have to link our CSS to our html by using:

```.html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css file">
```

To add things to our css we select either the `class`, `id`, or HTML tag that we want to apply the style sheet to. This allows us to dictate large or very specific groups to apply styles to. Remember, nesting is important! Double check your html to make sure you aren't applying conflicting instructions.
