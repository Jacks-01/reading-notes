# Choosing a text editor

When choosing a text editor it is mostly up to the user's preferance, but there are some important features that every text editor should have if you are going to be using it frequently to write code.

The most important ones would be:

- Syntax Highlighting

  - This will highlight important aspects of the syntax for easy referencing and debugging. Extremely useful for finding errors in your code.

- Themes

  - Themes are important becasue they can reduce eye strain and fatigue, especially when coding for long periods of time. 
 
  - They look cool.

  - The dopamine you get from getting a new theme can make you even more excited to code :octocat:

- Extensions

  - It is important to have a wide variety of extensions available to make your life easier. Extensions have many creative implementations like
    - Templates
    - Keyboard Shortcuts
    - App Integration (like GitHub)


But the most important thing to remember is that it all comes down to personal preference. You will function best with what you feel the most comfortable with, don't worry about changing it up 24/7. Being consistent with your tools is important to improving as long as it is not hurting you in the long run.
