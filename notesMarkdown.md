# Markdown Syntax Worksheet

Markdown (like all languages) is very sensitive to tiny changes, even when creating this page I was confused why my file wouldn't format my text as markup. Turns out, I forgot to add the .md to the page name. Without this there was nothing to tell GitHub what to do with all that text! All file extensions work like this- .html, .css, .js, etc.

If you know anything about html, markdown is incredibly similar. It was created to be a friendlier method of publishing content. When you are just working with the essentials of a website such as text and images it is much easier to only need to add one symbol rather than adding an opening and closing tag over and over.

For example:

Adding a paragraph to your traditional html website would formatted as such:

``` <p> This is a paragraph in html </p> ```
