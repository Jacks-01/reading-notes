### Questions:
___

#### [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

1.  Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
	- middleware is the manager that mediates communication across your application or function
2.  Express the most popular **__** **__** **__**____.
	- node web framework
3.  Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
	- that it is flexible and is not designed to be used for a specific set of tasks. It is very adaptable
4.  What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
	- a module is a file of code (or multiple). They are useful because they allow us to package things neatly and use their functionality in other parts of our application.

#### [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)

1.  What version of npm are you running on your machine?
	- 8.19.1
2.  What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
	- `npm i jshint`

#### [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/)

1.  Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
	- tests are important because sometimes things we create don't work the way we expect them to, or they may behave in a way they werent supposed to when given a non-ideal scenario.
1.  What are three expected benefits of testing
	- less frustrating development
	- better design quality
	- reduction in defect rates
1.  Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
	- writing too many tests
	- overly trivial tests
	- partial adoption
	- poor maintenance of the test suite

#### [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

1.  What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
	- makes sure your code integrates into the master branch
	- ensures consistency in the code
	- catch bugs
	- reduce merge conflicts
1.  What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
	- its an extension of Continuous deployment and allows more features and customizability.
2.  Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background
	- All changes make it to the CI server and decide if they will be able to merge. They use webhooks to talk to external systems. It creates a branch and runs tests then sends a response back.
