## Notes
___
- Lucking out is the worst way to solve problems, it doesn't really teach you anything
- video games can be problem solving (aka you can apply this thinking to almost anything)


### Problem Solving Steps
___
1. Understand
	- know exactly what is being asked, otherwise how can you solve it
	- You can test your understanding by explaining it in plain english.
2. Plan
	- Plan your solution
	- write down all of the exact steps 
	- give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information
	- "Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return the output Y?"
3. Divide
	- Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.
	- Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.
	- Solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the implest. Simplest means you know the answer or are close to it.
	- connect all of your "sub-solutions" to the original problem
	- Reduce the problem technique
		- reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of finding the third highest number, try find the highest one first. Or find the largest of just 3 numbers. 
4. Stuck?
	- debug debug debug
	- "The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do" - Andrew Singer
	- Is there anything that cna be abstracted to a more general approach?
	- look for patterns
	- delete everything and start anew
	-
