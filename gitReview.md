# Git Review

We use Git as a version control system. By doing this we are able to work with multiple people on one project on our own devices. This also gives us the option of going back to a previous version if something in the code breaks.

To bring something from our GitHub Repository down to our local system we first have to `git clone YOUR LINK` (Done by pressing the green code button on Github). Once your repository is on your computer you will change directories using `cd REPOSITORY NAME`. Once all of that is taken care of you can enter `code .` into your terminal to open up your text editor.

The typical flow for using git goes as follows:
`git add` - This will take whatever is on **YOUR** screen and create a snapshot of your current changes.
`git committ`- This will make your code the "head" deployment which is essentially the final draft before you submit the work. You can add comments by `git commit -m "[Message]"`
`git push`- This is the final step in order to take your code and upload it to GitHub.
