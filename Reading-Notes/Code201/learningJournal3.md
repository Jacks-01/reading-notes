# Learning Journal 3

> “For adult learners, their experience becomes the main resource of both their learning and the personal identity they have developed, as the richer and more diverse their experience, the more the diversity they can bring to their own learning.”

I think that I have a lot of experiences that contribute to me wanting to do software development. Being a gamer my whole life has allowed computers and most other technologies to become second nature. It's also easier to envision the application of software because I interact with it on a daily basis with my hobbies. I also have a fair amount of knowledge behind the IT side of it as well as the hardware side (from building my own computer and troubleshooting).
