# HTML Notes/Review

HTML is the bread and butter for your web page. HTML tells our web page how to structure the content we give it. It can also tell it certain styling features as well, but most of that is saved for CSS.

HTML Primary concepts:

* Layout
    - We must structure our page within specific tags so that our code knows where to put things. This would be the "html boilerplate" in your vscode (!DOCTYPE, body, head, etc).

* Elements
    - Elements are the tags that you will wrap the content with. Ex. `<h1>, <p>, <li>`.

* Attributes 
    - Attributes are descriptor words that are given to tags for a particular effect. For example, if we are adding a link with `<a>`(element), then the link we give it needs the *attribute*  `href`. The end result would be `<a href="image.jpg">`
