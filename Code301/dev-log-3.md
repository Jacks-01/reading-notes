# Dev-Log #3 6/3/2022

Yesterday I made a lot of progress on my home page, adding a responsive grid, and allowing users to search for a specific pokemon via a search bar. I also did some styling such as adding a header and making adjustments to the cards.

Today my goal is to get the favorite button to work so that a user can add and remove a pokemon from their favorites via their profile. I'm not sure if I will get to the user profile part, but at the very least I would have more functionality in my app with new CRUD functions. If I can get that done in a timely manner I would like to add a login page and integrate Auth0 into my app.
