## Class 01 : Introduction to React and Components


# Components


1. What is a “component”?
   - A component is a reusable and modular set of directions of code. It is not too different from a normal js function but it is designed to work as a piece and not the whole puzzle.
2. What are the characteristics of a component?
   - Reusable: can be placed in more than one spot, as long as it is generalized and not bound to a contextual task.
   - Replaceable: Can be swapped out at ease
   - Not context specific: If designed as so, components are versatile and can be used in several scenarios.
   - Extensible: a component can be improved from its original behavior 
   - Encapsulated: Does not reveal too much information to the user, contained.
   - Independent: does not rely heavily on other components.
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
    - It's reusable
    - Reliable
    - Independent
    - Easy to update one piece without changing everything else


## Props
    > Passing Data from one component to another

1. What is props short for
   - Properties
2. How are props used in react
   - They are used to pass data from one component to the next (in a single flow of data)
3. What is the flow of props
   - react operates on one-way data binding (meaning it goes top down).
