## SQL vs NoSQL

| SQL                          | NoSQL                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Table Based                  | Document Based        |
| Predefined Schema            | Dynamic Schema        |
| Vertically Scalable          | Horizontally Scalable |
| Structured Query Language    | unQL                  |
| large upfront setup requried | Big Data              |

  
    What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
        - SQL databases are better with larger data sets and where data integrity is important.
    Give a real world example.
        - Oracle, MySQL
    What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
        - big data, graphs, key value pairs.
    Give a real world example.
        - MongoDB, Redis
    Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
        - NoSQL
    Which type of database is best for scalability?
        - SQL



    What does SQL stand for?
        - Structured Query Language
    What is a relational database?
        - It is a SQL database (built out of tables)
    What type of structure does a relational database work with?
        - tables 
    What is a ‘schema’?
        - a Schema is a model for a document in the database. It is the structure to lay the data out in.
    What is a NoSQL database?
        - A document based database (Mongo)
    How does it work?
        - Data is stored inside of an object or schema and all of the data must fit that model. 
    What is inside of a Mongo database?
        - Documents
    Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
        - MongoDB, because you can make your data whatever you want. Relational databases are better for bigger applications that have more strict data types.
    What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
        - They aren't as fast because there is more computation involved. (excluding redis)
