## Growth Mindsets

> A growth mindset is synonymous with learning

A growth mindset is one that cultivates learning by encouraging hard work and following the learning process without being too hard on yourself. Talent and innate itelligence are merely the starting point for where you begin your learning adventure, they are not indicative of how the process will go. 

Your outlook on these core elements play a large role:

- Challenges
  - Embraces challenges instead of turning away when things get tough.
 
- Obstacles
  - Persists on the task at hand instead of turning away, views them as a learning opportunity.
 
- Effort
    - Understands that effort is required to learn anything, code is no exception. Acceptance that not everything will click instantly and that you will have to be patience with yourself.
 
- Criticism
  - Frames criticism as constructive, not a personal attack. Take a deep breath and keep your ears open.

- Success of Others
  - Views the successes of other people as something to celebrate and even learn from. Everyone else has to go through their own learning experience just like you, and respecting their experience is important if you want to respect your own.
