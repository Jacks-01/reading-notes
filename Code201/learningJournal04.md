# Learning Journal 04

> In other words, understanding your motivation for learning contributes to the effectiveness of your learning, and your learning journal is a place to explore those thoughts. What are your motivations for learning?

I feel that my motivation from learning comes from my desire to find a career I can enjoy long term. I was terribly burnt out from doing social work which sent me searching for something else to do for a career. I feel like I can apply the things I learn and even use coding as a creative outlet. It's easier for me to connect with because I am more of a logical person and I have spent most of my life obsessed with tech so I can get behind the lifestyle and the craft a lot easier. I think that there are a few strengths that I have that have shown up in ways I didn't expect. I also feel like I am developing new strengths and it helps me feel more confident in pursueing this long term.
