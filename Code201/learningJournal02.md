# Learning Journal 02

> “[Adult learners] are deeply involved not only in planning, but also in evaluating their learning, as they know what knowledge they want to acquire.”

- How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning?
  - I see myself reflecting quite a bit because this has been a very important decision in my life. I want to make sure that I am getting the most out of my experience, and I think these learning journals will help. I also keep my own journal for more personal self-development driven purposes. My ADHD plays a key role in my learning so I am constantly on my toes trying to manage my brain. If I am not intentional about how I learn then it becomes less important to me.
- What details will you record and/or measure? 
  - I want to measure things like hours spent on labs, time spent outside of school getting curious about code, and just making sure that I don't have long spans of time(more like day/weeks) where I don't code, I want to steadily make progress.
- How often will you evauluate what you want to learn?
  - I think reflecting after each unit is a good interval for me but I may change that depending how I feel after the first 2 weeks.
